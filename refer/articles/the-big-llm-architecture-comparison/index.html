At first glance, looking back at GPT-2 (2019) and forward to DeepSeek-V3 and Llama 4 (2024-2025), one might be surprised at how structurally similar these models still are.</p><p>Sure, positional embeddings have evolved from absolute to rotational (RoPE), Multi-Head Attention has largely given way to Grouped-Query Attention, and the more efficient SwiGLU has replaced activation functions like GELU. But beneath these minor refinements, have we truly seen groundbreaking changes, or are we simply polishing the same architectural foundations?</p><p>Comparing LLMs to determine the key ingredients that contribute to their good (or not-so-good) performance is notoriously challenging: datasets, training techniques, and hyperparameters vary widely and are often not well documented.</p><p>However, I think that there is still a lot of value in examining the structural changes of the architectures themselves to see what LLM developers are up to in 2025. (A subset of them are shown in Figure 1 below.)</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iCn-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ae4aa85-3e22-486c-9bd9-27edc4acbf8b_3000x2093.png" rel="" target="_blank"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 1: A subset of the architectures covered in this article.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>So, in this article, rather than writing about benchmark performance or training algorithms, I will focus on the architectural developments that define today's flagship open models.</p><p><span>(As you may remember, </span><a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/understanding-multimodal-llms" rel="">I wrote about multimodal LLMs</a><span> not too long ago; in this article, I will focus on the text capabilities of recent models and leave the discussion of multimodal capabilities for another time.)</span></p><p><strong>Tip:</strong><span> This is a fairly comprehensive article, so I recommend using the navigation bar to access the table of contents (just hover over the left side of the Substack page).</span></p><p><span>As you have probably heard more than once by now, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948" rel="">DeepSeek R1</a><span> made a big impact when it was released in January 2025. DeepSeek R1 is a reasoning model built on top of the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437" rel="">DeepSeek V3 architecture</a><span>, which was introduced in December 2024.</span></p><p>While my focus here is on architectures released in 2025, I think it’s reasonable to include DeepSeek V3, since it only gained widespread attention and adoption following the launch of DeepSeek R1 in 2025.</p><p>If you are interested in the training of DeepSeek R1 specifically, you may also find my article from earlier this year useful: </p><p>In this section, I’ll focus on two key architectural techniques introduced in DeepSeek V3 that improved its computational efficiency and distinguish it from many other LLMs:</p><p>Before discussing Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), let's briefly go over some background to motivate why it's used. For that, let's start with Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), which has become the new standard replacement for a more compute- and parameter-efficient alternative to Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in recent years.</p><p>So, here's a brief GQA summary. Unlike MHA, where each head also has its own set of keys and values, to reduce memory usage, GQA groups multiple heads to share the same key and value projections. </p><p>For example, as further illustrated in Figure 2 below, if there are 2 key-value groups and 4 attention heads, then heads 1 and 2 might share one set of keys and values, while heads 3 and 4 share another. This reduces the total number of key and value computations, which leads to lower memory usage and improved efficiency (without noticeably affecting the modeling performance, according to ablation studies).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uVhV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F647caf83-cd3d-46f8-8bd0-0946bd896ea1_1023x474.png" rel="" target="_blank"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Figure 2: A comparison between MHA and GQA. Here, the group size is 2, where a key and value pair is shared among 2 queries.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>So, the core idea behind GQA is to reduce the number of key and value heads by sharing them across multiple query heads. This (1) lowers the model's parameter count and (2) reduces the memory bandwidth usage for key and value tensors during inference since fewer keys and values need to be stored and retrieved from the KV cache.</p><p><span>(If you are curious how GQA looks in code, see my</span><a href="https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch05/07_gpt_to_llama/converting-llama2-to-llama3.ipynb" rel=""> GPT-2 to Llama 3 conversion guide</a><span> for a version without KV cache and my KV-cache variant </span><a href="https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/pkg/llms_from_scratch/llama3.py" rel="">here</a><span>.)</span></p><p><span>While GQA is mainly a computational-efficiency workaround for MHA, ablation studies (such as those in the</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13245" rel=""> original GQA paper</a><span> and the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288" rel="">Llama 2 paper</a><span>) show it performs comparably to standard MHA in terms of LLM modeling performance.</span></p><p>Now, Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers a different memory-saving strategy that also pairs particularly well with KV caching. Instead of sharing key and value heads like GQA, MLA compresses the key and value tensors into a lower-dimensional space before storing them in the KV cache. </p><p>At inference time, these compressed tensors are projected back to their original size before being used, as shown in the Figure 3 below. This adds an extra matrix multiplication but reduces memory usage.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jagJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb9a75be-2848-4b99-af3d-4c48bdd0181a_1550x858.png" rel="" target="_blank"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Figure 3: Comparison between MLA (used in DeepSeek V3 and R1) and regular MHA.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>(As a side note, the queries are also compressed, but only during training, not inference.)</p><p><span>By the way, MLA is not new in DeepSeek V3, as its </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434" rel="">DeepSeek-V2 predecessor</a><span> also used (and even introduced) it. Also, the V2 paper contains a few interesting ablation studies that may explain why the DeepSeek team chose MLA over GQA (see Figure 4 below).</span></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!efDX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b7e646a-16c1-4245-9a3f-55a41f3070c2_903x856.png" rel="" target="_blank"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 4: Annotated tables from the DeepSeek-V2 paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p></p><p>As shown in Figure 4 above, GQA appears to perform worse than MHA, whereas MLA offers better modeling performance than MHA, which is likely why the DeepSeek team chose MLA over GQA. (It would have been interesting to see the "KV Cache per Token" savings comparison between MLA and GQA as well!)</p><p>To summarize this section before we move on to the next architecture component, MLA is a clever trick to reduce KV cache memory use while even slightly outperforming MHA in terms of modeling performance.</p><p>The other major architectural component in DeepSeek worth highlighting is its use of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers. While DeepSeek did not invent MoE, it has seen a resurgence this year, and many of the architectures we will cover later also adopt it.</p><p>You are likely already familiar with MoE, but a quick recap may be helpful.</p><p>The core idea in MoE is to replace each FeedForward module in a transformer block with multiple expert layers, where each of these expert layers is also a FeedForward module. This means that we swap a single FeedForward block for multiple FeedForward blocks, as illustrated in the Figure 5 below.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e3O4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4efdd493-d8c8-4038-ad24-20d6db86eae8_1600x1009.png" rel="" target="_blank"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Figure 5: An illustration of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module in DeepSeek V3/R1 (right) compared to an LLM with a standard FeedForward block (left).</em></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>The FeedForward block inside a transformer block (shown as the dark gray block in the figure above) typically contains a large number of the model's total parameters. (Note that the transformer block, and thereby the FeedForward block, is repeated many times in an LLM; in the case of DeepSeek-V3, 61 times.)</p><p><span>So, replacing </span><em>a single</em><span> FeedForward block with </span><em>multiple</em><span> FeedForward blocks (as done in a MoE setup) substantially increases the model's total parameter count. However, the key trick is that we don't use ("activate") all experts for every token. Instead, a router selects only a small subset of experts per token. (In the interest of time, or rather article space, I'll cover the router in more detail another time.)</span></p><p><span>Because only a few experts are active at a time, MoE modules are often referred to as </span><em>sparse</em><span>, in contrast to </span><em>dense</em><span> modules that always use the full parameter set. However, the large total number of parameters via an MoE increases the capacity of the LLM, which means it can take up more knowledge during training. The sparsity keeps inference efficient, though, as we don't use all the parameters at the same time.</span></p><p>For example, DeepSeek-V3 has 256 experts per MoE module and a total of 671 billion parameters. Yet during inference, only 9 experts are active at a time (1 shared expert plus 8 selected by the router). This means just 37 billion parameters are used per inference step as opposed to all 671 billion.</p><p><span>One notable feature of DeepSeek-V3's MoE design is the use of a shared expert. This is an expert that is always active for every token. This idea is not new and was already introduced in the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06066" rel="">DeepSeek 2024 MoE</a><span> and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05596" rel="">2022 DeepSpeedMoE paper</a><span>s. </span></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d93c441-a6d2-4257-bd80-2d3590c4001c_1039x569.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Figure 6: An annotated figure from "DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in Mixture-of-Experts Language Models", https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06066</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The benefit of having a shared expert was first noted in the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05596" rel="">DeepSpeedMoE paper</a><span>, where they found that it boosts overall modeling performance compared to no shared experts. This is likely because common or repeated patterns don't have to be learned by multiple individual experts, which leaves them with more room for learning more specialized patterns.</span></p><p>To summarize, DeepSeek-V3 is a massive 671-billion-parameter model that, at launch, outperformed other open-weight models, including the 405B Llama 3. Despite being larger, it is much more efficient at inference time thanks to its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which activates only a small subset of (just 37B) parameters per token.</p><p>Another key distinguishing feature is DeepSeek-V3's use of Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) instead of Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). Both MLA and GQA are inference-efficient alternatives to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), particularly when using KV caching. While MLA is more complex to implement, a study in the DeepSeek-V2 paper has shown it delivers better modeling performance than GQA.</p><p>The OLMo series of models by the non-profit Allen Institute for AI is noteworthy due to its transparency in terms of training data and code, as well as the relatively detailed technical reports.</p><p>While you probably won’t find OLMo models at the top of any benchmark or leaderboard, they are pretty clean and, more importantly, a great blueprint for developing LLMs, thanks to their transparency.</p><p><span>And while OLMo models are popular because of their transparency, they are not that bad either. In fact, at the time of release in January (before Llama 4, Gemma 3, and Qwen 3), </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00656" rel="">OLMo 2</a><span> models were sitting at the Pareto frontier of compute to performance, as shown in Figure 7 below.</span></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb5c7281-eded-4319-9ae2-7b07478a86b2_1027x823.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 7: Modeling benchmark performance (higher is better) vs pre-training cost (FLOPs; lower is better) for different LLMs. This is an annotated figure from the OLMo 2 paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00656</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>As mentioned earlier in this article, I aim to focus only on the LLM architecture details (not training or data) to keep it at a manageable length. So, what were the interesting architectural design choices in OLMo2 ? It mainly comes down to normalizations: the placement of RMSNorm layers as well as the addition of a QK-norm, which I will discuss below.</p><p>Another thing worth mentioning is that OLMo 2 still uses traditional Multi-Head Attention (MHA) instead of MLA or GQA.</p><p>Overall, OLMo 2 largely follows the architecture of the original GPT model,  similar to other contemporary LLMs. However, there are some noteworthy deviations. Let's start with the normalization layers.</p><p>Similar to Llama, Gemma, and most other LLMs, OLMo 2 switched from LayerNorm to RMSNorm.</p><p><span>But since RMSNorm is old hat (it's basically a simplified version of LayerNorm with fewer trainable parameters), I will skip the discussion of RMSNorm vs LayerNorm. (Curious readers can find an RMSNorm code implementation in my </span><a href="https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch05/07_gpt_to_llama/converting-gpt-to-llama2.ipynb" rel="">GPT-2 to Llama conversion guide</a><span>.)</span></p><p><span>However, it's worth discussing the placement of the RMSNorm layer. The original transformer (from the "</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" rel="">Attention is all you need</a><span>" paper) placed the two normalization layers in the transformer block </span><em>after</em><strong> </strong><span>the attention module and the FeedForward module, respectively.</span></p><p>This is also known as Post-LN or Post-Norm.</p><p><span>GPT and most other LLMs that came after placed the normalization layers </span><em>before</em><span> the attention and FeedForward modules, which is known as Pre-LN or Pre-Norm. A comparison between Post- and Pre-Norm is shown in the figure below.</span></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61a4560f-d97f-4c78-a7a3-765babb45bec_1444x789.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Figure 8: A comparison of Post-Norm, Pre-Norm, and OLMo 2's flavor of Post-Norm.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04745" rel="">2020, Xiong et al.</a><span> showed that Pre-LN results in more well-behaved gradients at initialization. Furthermore, the researchers mentioned that Pre-LN even works well without careful learning rate warm-up, which is otherwise a crucial tool for Post-LN.</span></p><p><span>Now, the reason I am mentioning that is that OLMo 2 adopted a form of Post-LN (but with RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm, so I am calling it </span><em>Post-Norm</em><span>).</span></p><p>In OLMo 2, instead of placing the normalization layers before the attention and FeedForward layers, they place them after, as shown in the figure above. However, notice that in contrast to the original transformer architecture, the normalization layers are still inside the residual layers (skip connections).</p><p><span>So, why did they move the position of the normalization layers?</span><strong> </strong><span>The reason is that it helped with training stability, as shown in the figure below.</span></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ebW0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F186190ec-2ae5-430d-b0d4-a63486e0f3fb_1289x407.png" rel="" target="_blank"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Figure 9: A plot showing the training stability for Pre-Norm (like in GPT-2, Llama 3, and many others) versus OLMo 2's flavor of Post-Norm.

If we think of regular self-attention as a </span><em>global</em><span> attention mechanism, since each sequence element can access every other sequence element, then we can think of sliding window attention as </span><em>local</em><span> attention, because here we restrict the context size around the current query position. This is illustrated in the figure below.</span></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff32c2d74-ec34-43ef-86bc-bcce832426b3_1600x792.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Figure 12: A comparison between regular attention (left) and sliding window attention (right).</em></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>Please note that sliding window attention can be used with both Multi-Head Attention and Grouped-Query Attention; Gemma 3 uses grouped-query attention.</p><p><span>As mentioned above, sliding window attention is also referred to as </span><em>local</em><span> attention because the local window surrounds and moves with the current query position. In contrast, regular attention is </span><em>global</em><span> as each token can access all other tokens.</span></p><p>Now, as briefly mentioned above, the Gemma 2 predecessor architecture also used sliding window attention before. The difference in Gemma 3 is that they adjusted the ratio between global (regular) and local (sliding) attention.</p><p>For instance, Gemma 2 uses a hybrid attention mechanism that combines sliding window (local) and global attention in a 1:1 ratio. Each token can attend to a 4k-token window of nearby context.</p><p>Where Gemma 2 used sliding window attention in every other layer, Gemma 3 now has a 5:1 ratio, meaning there's only 1 full attention layer for every 5 sliding windows (local) attention layers; moreover, the sliding window size was reduced from 4096 (Gemma 2) to just 1024 (Gemma 3). This shifts the model's focus towards more efficient, localized computations.</p><p>According to their ablation study, the use of sliding window attention has minimal impact on modeling performance, as shown in the figure below.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSZb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F788a5023-1ba3-4372-89cd-4ebeff132255_1600x477.png" rel="" target="_blank"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 13: An annotated figure from Gemma 3 paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19786) showing that sliding window attention has little to no impact on the LLM-generated output perplexity.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>While sliding window attention is the most notable architecture aspect of Gemma 3, I want to also briefly go over the placement of the normalization layers as a follow-up to the previous OLMo 2 section.</p><p>A small but interesting tidbit to highlight is that Gemma 3 uses RMSNorm in both a Pre-Norm and Post-Norm setting around its grouped-query attention module.</p><p>This is similar to Gemma 2 but still worth highlighting, as it differs from (1) the Post-Norm used in the original transformer (“Attention is all you need”), (2) the Pre-Norm, which was popularized by GPT-2 and used in many other architectures afterwards, and (3) the Post-Norm flavor in OLMo 2 that we saw earlier.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F752ec4b7-2720-44f8-958b-0ca85b3a96f1_1068x855.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Figure 14: An architecture comparison between OLMo2 and Gemma 3; note the additional normalization layers in Gemma 3.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>I think this normalization layer placement is a relatively intuitive approach as it gets the best of both worlds: Pre-Norm and Post-Norm. In my opinion, a bit of extra normalization can't hurt. In the worst case, if the extra normalization is redundant, this adds a bit of inefficiency through redundancy. In practice, since RMSNorm is relatively cheap in the grand scheme of things, this shouldn't have any noticeable impact, though.</p><p>Gemma 3 is a well-performing open-weight LLM that, in my opinion, is a bit underappreciated in the open-source circles. The most interesting part is the use of sliding window attention to improve efficiency (it will be interesting to combine it with MoE in the future).</p><p>Also, Gemma 3 has a unique normalization layer placement, placing RMSNorm layers both before and after the attention and FeedForward modules.</p><p><span>A few months after the Gemma 3 release, Google shared </span><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n/" rel="">Gemma 3n</a><span>, which is a Gemma 3 model that has been optimized for small-device efficiency with the goal of running on phones.</span></p><p>One of the changes in Gemma 3n to achieve better efficiency is the so-called Per-Layer Embedding (PLE) parameters layer. The key idea here is to keep only a subset of the model's parameters in GPU memory. Token-layer specific embeddings, such as those for text, audio, and vision modalities, are then streamed from the CPU or SSD on demand.</p><p>The figure below illustrates the PLE memory savings, listing 5.44 billion parameters for a standard Gemma 3 model. This likely refers to the Gemma 3 4-billion variant.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb05999d6-88ca-4739-8b0b-266b48da288b_662x483.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 15: An annotated figure from Google's Gemma 3n blog (https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n/) illustrating the PLE memory savings.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The 5.44 vs. 4 billion parameter discrepancy is because Google has an interesting way of reporting parameter counts in LLMs. They often exclude embedding parameters to make the model appear smaller, except in cases like this, where it is convenient to include them to make the model appear larger. This is not unique to Google, as this approach has become a common practice across the field.</p><p><span>Another interesting trick is the</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07707" rel=""> MatFormer</a><span> concept (short for Matryoshka Transformer). For instance, Gemma 3n uses a single shared LLM (transformer) architecture that can be sliced into smaller, independently usable models. Each slice is trained to function on its own, so at inference time, we can run just the part you need (instead of the large model).</span></p><p><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3-1" rel="">Mistral Small 3.1 24B</a><span>, which was released in March shortly after Gemma 3, is noteworthy for outperforming Gemma 3 27B on several benchmarks (except for math) while being faster.</span></p><p>The reasons for the lower inference latency of Mistral Small 3.1 over Gemma 3 are likely due to their custom tokenizer, as well as shrinking the KV cache and layer count. Otherwise, it's a standard architecture as shown in the figure below.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZZnO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa861f68d-c50c-471c-bae1-2308c135bb54_1460x793.png" rel="" target="_blank"></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Figure 16: An architecture comparison between Gemma 3 27B and Mistral 3.1 Small 24B.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>Interestingly, earlier Mistral models had utilized sliding window attention, but they appear to have abandoned it in Mistral Small 3.1. So, since Mistral uses regular Grouped-Query Attention instead of Grouped-Query Attention with a sliding window as in Gemma 3, maybe there are additional inference compute savings due to being able to use more optimized code (i.e., FlashAttention). For instance, I speculate that while sliding window attention reduces memory usage, it doesn't necessarily reduce inference latency, which is what Mistral Small 3.1 is focused on.</p><p><span>The extensive introductory discussion on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) earlier in this article pays off again. </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/" rel="">Llama 4</a><span> has also adopted an MoE approach and otherwise follows a relatively standard architecture that is very similar to DeepSeek-V3, as shown in the figure below. (Llama 4 includes native multimodal support, similar to models like Gemma and Mistral. However, since this article focuses on language modeling, we only focus on the text model.)</span></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17518ff9-1f60-4aca-b654-034dabe20626_1600x823.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 17: An architecture comparison between DeepSeek V3 (671-billion parameters) and Llama 4 Maverick (400-billion parameters).</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p>While the Llama 4 Maverick architecture looks very similar to DeepSeek-V3 overall, there are some interesting differences worth highlighting.</p><p>First, Llama 4 uses Grouped-Query Attention similar to its predecessors, whereas DeepSeek-V3 uses Multi-Head Latent Attention, which we discussed at the beginning of this article. Now, both DeepSeek-V3 and Llama 4 Maverick are very large architectures, with DeepSeek-V3 being approximately 68% larger in its total parameter count. However, with 37 billion active parameters, DeepSeek-V3 has more than twice as many active parameters as Llama 4 Maverick (17B).</p><p>Llama 4 Maverick uses a more classic MoE setup with fewer but larger experts (2 active experts with 8,192 hidden size each) compared to DeepSeek-V3 (9 active experts with 2,048 hidden size each). Also, DeepSeek uses MoE layers in each transformer block (except the first 3), whereas Llama 4 alternates MoE and dense modules in every other transformer block.</p><p>Given the many small differences between architectures, it is difficult to determine their exact impact on final model performance. The main takeaway, however, is that MoE architectures have seen a significant rise in popularity in 2025.</p><p>The Qwen team consistently delivers high-quality open-weight LLMs. When I helped co-advising the LLM efficiency challenge at NeurIPS 2023, I remember that the top winning solutions were all Qwen2-based.</p><p>Now, Qwen3 is another hit model series at the top of the leaderboards for their size classes. There are 7 dense models: 0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, 14B, and 32B. And there are 2 MoE models: 30B-A3B, and 235B-A22B.</p><p>(By the way, note that the missing whitespace in "Qwen3" is not a typo; I simply try to preserve the original spelling the Qwen developers chose.)</p><p>Let's discuss the dense model architecture first. As of this writing, the 0.6B model may well be the smallest current-generation open-weight model out there. And based on my personal experience, it performs really well given its small size. It has great token/sec throughput and a low memory footprint if you are planning to run it locally. But what's more, it's also easy to train locally (for educational purposes) due to its small size.</p><p>So, Qwen3 0.6B has replaced Llama 3 1B for me for most purposes. A comparison between these two architectures is shown below.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5185aaf2-0130-42c3-8705-2b58c17e6c66_1331x807.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 18: An architecture comparison between Qwen3 0.6B and Llama 3 1B; notice that Qwen3 is a deeper architecture with more layers, whereas Llama 3 is a wider architecture with more attention heads.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p><span>If you are interested in a human-readable Qwen3 implementation without external third-party LLM library dependencies, I recently implemented </span><a href="https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch05/11_qwen3" rel="">Qwen3 from scratch (in pure PyTorch)</a><span>.</span></p><p>The computational performance numbers in the figure above are based on my from-scratch PyTorch implementations when run on an A100 GPU. As one can see, Qwen3 has a smaller memory footprint as it is a smaller architecture overall, but also uses smaller hidden layers and fewer attention heads. However, it uses more transformer blocks than Llama 3, which leads to a slower runtime (lower tokens/sec generation speed).</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Qwen3 also comes in two MoE flavors: 30B-A3B and 235B-A22B. Why do some architectures, like Qwen3, come as regular (dense) and MoE (sparse) variants?</p><p>As mentioned at the beginning of this article, MoE variants help reduce inference costs for large base models. Offering both dense and MoE versions gives users flexibility depending on their goals and constraints.</p><p>Dense models are typically more straightforward to fine-tune, deploy, and optimize across various hardware.</p><p>On the other hand, MoE models are optimized for scaling inference. For instance, at a fixed inference budget, they can achieve a higher overall model capacity (i.e., knowledge uptake during training due to being larger) without proportionally increasing inference costs.</p><p>By releasing both types, the Qwen3 series can support a broader range of use cases: dense models for robustness, simplicity, and fine-tuning, and MoE models for efficient serving at scale.</p><p>To round up this section, let's look at Qwen3 235B-A22B (note that the A22B stands for "22B active parameters) to DeepSeek-V3, which has almost twice as many active parameters (37B).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75de0da5-5bfb-407d-8a05-a3def4121807_1476x750.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 19: An architecture comparison between DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 235B-A22B.</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span>As shown in the figure above, the DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 235B-A22B architectures are remarkably similar. What's noteworthy, though, is that the Qwen3 model moved away from using a shared expert (earlier Qwen models, such as </span><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/" rel="">Qwen2.5-MoE</a><span> did use a shared expert).</span></p><p>Unfortunately, the Qwen3 team did not disclose any reason as to why they moved away from shared experts. If I had to guess, it was perhaps simply not necessary for training stability for their setup when they increased the experts from 2 (in Qwen2.5-MoE) to 8 (in Qwen3). And then they were able to save the extra compute/memory cost by using only 8 instead of 8+1 experts.

Moreover, as far as I know, the Kimi 1.5 weights were never publicly shared.</span></p><p>So, most likely the Kimi K2 team took these lessons to heart and shared Kimi K2 as an open-weight model, before DeepSeek R2 was released. As of this writing, Kimi K2 is the most impressive open-weight model.</p><p><span>OpenAI’s </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/" rel="">released</a><span> gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, their first open-weight models since GPT-2 in 2019, about one week after I wrote this article. Since OpenAI’s open-weight models have been so widely anticipated, I updated this article to include them. I will keep this section brief, but I have written another, much more detailed article dedicated to the gpt-oss models here:</span></p><p></p><p>Before summarizing the interesting tidbits, let's start with an overview of the two models, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, as shown in Figure 26 below.</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d438dde-c0f6-4e99-a0a8-b41e11366a27_1631x788.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 26: Architecture overview of the two gpt-oss models.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Looking at Figure 26, the architecture contains all the familiar components we have seen in other architectures discussed previously. For instance, Figure 27 puts the smaller gpt-oss architecture next to Qwen3 30B-A3B, which is also an MoE model with a similar number of active parameters (gpt-oss has 3.6B active parameters, and Qwen3 30B-A3B has 3.3B).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc79215d3-891e-431f-af20-8e2a3fa4be10_1552x799.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 27: Architecture comparison between gpt-oss and Qwen3</figcaption></figure></div><p>One aspect not shown in Figure 27 is that gpt-oss uses sliding window attention (similar to Gemma 3, but in every other layer instead of using a 5:1 ratio). </p><p>Figure 27 shows that gpt-oss and Qwen3 use similar components. But if we look at the two models closely, we see that Qwen3 is a much deeper architecture with its 48 transformer blocks instead of 24.</p><p>On the other hand, gpt-oss is a much wider architecture:</p><p>It's also worth noting that gpt-oss uses twice as many attention heads, but this doesn't directly increase the model's width. The width is determined by the embedding dimension.</p><p>Does one approach offer advantages over the other given a fixed number of parameters? As a rule of thumb, deeper models have more flexibility but can be harder to train due to instability issues, due to exploding and vanishing gradients (which RMSNorm and shortcut connections aim to mitigate).</p><p>Wider architectures have the advantage of being faster during inference (with a higher tokens/second throughput) due to better parallelization at a higher memory cost.</p><p><span>When it comes to modeling performance, there's unfortunately no good apples-to-apples comparison I am aware of (where parameter size and datasets are kept constant) except for an ablation study in the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00118" rel="">Gemma 2 paper (Table 9)</a><span>, which found that for a 9B parameter architecture, a wider setup is slightly better than a deeper setup. Across 4 benchmarks, the wider model achieved a 52.0 average score, and the deeper model achieved a 50.8 average score.</span></p><p>As shown in Figure 27 above, it's also noteworthy that gpt-oss has a surprisingly small number of experts (32 instead of 128), and only uses 4 instead of 8 active experts per token. However, each expert is much larger than the experts in Qwen3.</p><p>This is interesting because the recent trends and developments point towards more, smaller models as being beneficial. This change, at a constant total parameter size, is nicely illustrated in Figure 28 below from the DeepSeekMoE paper.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F019ead67-6811-4c9d-af7b-4e6b2563ea68_1046x565.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 28: An annotated figure from "DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in Mixture-of-Experts Language Models", https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06066</figcaption></figure></div><p>Notably, unlike DeepSeek's models, neither gpt-oss nor Qwen3 uses shared experts, though.</p><p>Both gpt-oss and Qwen3 use grouped query attention. The main difference is that gpt-oss restricts the context size via sliding window attention in each second layer, as mentioned earlier.</p><p>However, there's one interesting detail that caught my eye. It seems that gpt-oss uses bias units for the attention weights, as shown in Figure 29 below.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15ddb1b6-1540-4889-86c5-c54f5918562e_1221x352.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 29: gpt-oss models use bias units in the attention layers. See code example here.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>I haven't seen these bias units being used since the GPT-2 days, and they are commonly regarded as redundant. Indeed, I found a recent paper that shows mathematically that this is at least true for the key transformation (</span><code>k_proj</code><span>). Furthermore, the empirical results show that there is little difference between with and without bias units (see Figure 30 below).</span></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vQ5q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2fa2e161-ba61-43ab-a17b-5e6eab448699_307x151.png" rel="" target="_blank"></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Figure 30: Table from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08626 showing the average test loss when the models were trained from scratch with and without bias units.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Another detail you may have noticed is the definition of </span><code>sinks</code><span> in the code screenshot in Figure 30. In general models, attention sinks are special "always-attended" tokens placed at the start of the sequence to stabilize attention, which is especially useful in long-context scenarios. I.e., if the context gets very long, this special attended token at the beginning is still attended to, and it can learn to store some generally useful information about the entire sequence. (I think it was originally proposed in the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453" rel="">Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks</a><span> paper.)</span></p><p><span>In the gpt-oss implementation, </span><em>attention sinks</em><span> are not actual tokens in the input sequence. Instead, they are learned per-head bias logits that are appended to the attention scores (Figure 31). The goal is the same as with the above-mentioned attention sinks, but without modifying the tokenized inputs.</span></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img src="images/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F389b83da-f588-4e54-93ca-716d60d7f087_1064x754.png"/><figcaption class="image-caption"><span>Figure 31: The use of attention sinks in gpt-oss; based on the Hugging Face code </span><a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blame/369c99d0cea403b77bd0aef818527106453fd9fc/src/transformers/models/gpt_oss/modular_gpt_oss.py" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>For more information about gpt-oss, and how it compares to GPT-2, please see my other gpt-oss article:</p><p></p><p><strong>After all these years, LLM releases remain exciting, and I am curious to see what's next!</strong></p><p></p><p><hr/></p><p><em>This magazine is a personal passion project, and your support helps keep it alive.
