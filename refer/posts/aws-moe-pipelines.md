# AWS Architecture for MoE LLM Training and Inference Pipelines

Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved significantly from the original GPT architecture, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models emerging as one of the most promising architectural innovations. MoE models offer dramatic improvements in computational efficiency by activating only a subset of parameters for each input token. This article explores how to build robust training and inference pipelines for MoE LLMs using AWS's specialized infrastructure.

## Understanding MoE LLM Architecture

Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture represents a significant advancement in LLM design. Unlike dense models where all parameters are used for every input, MoE models use a sparse activation pattern:

### Key MoE Model Characteristics

- **Total Parameters**: 671 billion parameters
- **Active Parameters**: Only 37 billion parameters active per inference (5.5%)
- **Expert Structure**: 256 experts per MoE module
- **Expert Activation**: Only 9 experts activated per token
- **Attention Mechanism**: Multi-Head Latent Attention for superior memory efficiency

This sparse activation pattern delivers several advantages:
- Reduced computational requirements during inference
- Lower memory footprint
- Ability to scale to much larger model sizes
- Specialized experts for different types of queries

## AWS Infrastructure Overview

The complete AWS architecture for MoE LLM training and inference combines multiple specialized services:

This architecture leverages AWS's purpose-built AI infrastructure, particularly the SageMaker HyperPod platform, which provides specialized capabilities for large-scale model training with built-in resilience and optimization.

## Training Pipeline Components

## Workflow Sequence

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete workflow from training to inference:

![MoE LLM Training and Inference Sequence](/diagrams/MoE%20LLM%20Training%20and%20Inference%20Sequence.png)

This sequence diagram shows the key interactions between different components of the system:

1. **Training Phase**:
   - Data scientists initiate the process by creating a training cluster in SageMaker HyperPod
   - Training data flows from S3 storage to FSx for Lustre for high-performance access
   - The training cluster (P5e instances) executes the MoE model training
   - Checkpoints and model artifacts are stored back to S3 via the Model Registry

2. **Deployment Phase**:
   - ML Engineers retrieve the trained model from storage
   - The model is deployed to the inference cluster (Inf2 instances)
   - Active experts are cached in ElastiCache while inactive experts are stored in S3

3. **Inference Phase**:
   - End users send requests through the API layer
   - The inference cluster processes requests using the MoE router to select appropriate experts
   - Active experts are retrieved from cache, while inactive experts are loaded from S3 when needed
   - Results are returned to users via the API layer

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Performance metrics are continuously logged to the monitoring system
   - Visualizations and alerts help maintain optimal system performance

This streamlined workflow demonstrates how data flows through the system from initial training data preparation to final inference response delivery, highlighting the key interactions between components.

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture shows how the various components are distributed across AWS infrastructure:
