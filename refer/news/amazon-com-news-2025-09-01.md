## 2. Amazon SageMaker introduces account-agnostic, reusable project profiles

**Description:** Amazon SageMaker introduces account-agnostic, reusable project profiles (templates) in Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio domain, enabling domain administrators to define project configurations once and reuse them across multiple AWS accounts and regions. Project profiles are no longer tied to a specific AWS account or region. Instead, platform teams can reference an account poolâ€”a new domain entity that enables dynamic account and region selection at the time of project creation, based on custom evaluation criteria.
