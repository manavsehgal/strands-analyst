# AWS Architecture for MoE LLM Training and Inference Pipeline

This document explains the AWS architecture for implementing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Large Language Model (LLM) training and inference pipeline, based on the analysis of modern LLM architectures and AWS services.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture consists of two main pipelines:
1. **Training Pipeline**: Responsible for efficiently training the MoE LLM model
2. **Inference Pipeline**: Optimized for serving the trained model with low latency

Both pipelines leverage specialized AWS services and instance types designed for AI/ML workloads, with particular focus on the unique requirements of MoE architectures.
