  --innovation 9 \
  --cost 6 \
  --output my_analysis.json
```

#### Python API Usage
```python
from probabilistic_era_analyzer import ProbabilisticEraAnalyzer, ScenarioInput, IndustryType, StageType

# Create scenario
scenario = ScenarioInput(
    industry=IndustryType.SOFTWARE,
    product_type="ai-native",
    challenge="Building a code generation tool",
    stage=StageType.GROWTH,
    uncertainty_tolerance=8,
    innovation_priority=9,
    cost_sensitivity=6
)

# Analyze
analyzer = ProbabilisticEraAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_scenario(scenario)

print(f"Recommended approach: {result.recommended_approach.value}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence_score:.2%}")
```
