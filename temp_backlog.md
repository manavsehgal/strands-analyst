    **Result**: ArXiv URLs and other PDF URLs are now properly recognized and converted to markdown using the new `download_pdf_to_markdown` tool. Users can directly provide ArXiv paper URLs to `analystai` and receive high-quality markdown conversions with image extraction and metadata preservation. The tool intelligently detects PDF URLs and routes them to appropriate processing instead of generic web article extraction, solving the original issue completely.

[ ] Create comprehensive message-level caching system for conversation continuity in chat agents, including cache invalidation strategies, hit/miss metrics monitoring, and request-level caching for repeated tool operations.

[ ] Build multi-agent orchestration framework implementing the agents-as-tools pattern with workflow management, dependency tracking, concurrent tool execution, and agent specialization for domain-specific tasks.

[ ] Integrate OpenTelemetry for standardized instrumentation with trace collection for model and tool invocations, comprehensive performance dashboards, automated alerts for performance degradation, and user interaction feedback metrics.

[ ] Optimize tool execution performance with intelligent context-based tool selection, concurrent execution for independent operations via ToolExecutor, lazy initialization for tool loading, and tool result caching for expensive operations.
