[ ] Create comprehensive message-level caching system for conversation continuity in chat agents, including cache invalidation strategies, hit/miss metrics monitoring, and request-level caching for repeated tool operations.

[ ] Build multi-agent orchestration framework implementing the agents-as-tools pattern with workflow management, dependency tracking, concurrent tool execution, and agent specialization for domain-specific tasks.

[ ] Integrate OpenTelemetry for standardized instrumentation with trace collection for model and tool invocations, comprehensive performance dashboards, automated alerts for performance degradation, and user interaction feedback metrics.

[ ] Optimize tool execution performance with intelligent context-based tool selection, concurrent execution for independent operations via ToolExecutor, lazy initialization for tool loading, and tool result caching for expensive operations.

[ ] Implement real-time cost optimization framework with per-agent cost tracking, budgeting and alerting mechanisms, cost-aware model selection, token usage optimization recommendations, and cost analysis reporting dashboards.

[ ] Enhance security guardrails with advanced prompt injection defense patterns, structured input validation with clear section delimiters, adversarial example detection, Bedrock guardrails integration, and security audit trails for sensitive operations.

[ ] Create automated quality assurance system with agent behavior consistency testing, performance regression testing, output quality scoring, A/B testing framework for agent improvements, and continuous evaluation pipelines.
