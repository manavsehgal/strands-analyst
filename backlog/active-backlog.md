# Active Backlog

[x] Review backlog/backlog-archive-002.md for examples of how backlog items are written. Now review the open items in backlog/performance-backlog.md and create open [ ] backlog items in this file to help complete the recommendations.

    **Completion Summary (2025-09-05):**
    - ✅ **Reviewed backlog examples**: Analyzed backlog-archive-002.md to understand proper backlog item format with completion summaries and technical details
    - ✅ **Analyzed performance recommendations**: Reviewed performance-backlog.md identifying high and medium priority remaining tasks from 12 performance optimization areas
    - ✅ **Created actionable backlog items**: Extracted 8 high-priority items focused on immediate performance impact and implementation feasibility
    - ✅ **Prioritized based on impact**: Selected items that leverage existing architecture and provide measurable performance improvements
    
    **Key Items Added**:
    - Dynamic AWS Bedrock model configuration and warm-up capabilities
    - Advanced caching with message-level support and metrics monitoring  
    - Multi-agent orchestration framework using agents-as-tools pattern
    - OpenTelemetry integration for production-grade observability
    - Concurrent tool execution optimization for multi-tool workflows
    - Real-time cost tracking and budgeting mechanisms
    - Advanced security guardrails with prompt injection defense
    - Automated quality assurance testing framework
    
    **Result**: Active backlog now contains 8 actionable items derived from performance-backlog.md recommendations, focusing on high-impact optimizations that can be implemented with current architecture.

[ ] Implement dynamic AWS Bedrock model configuration updates and model warm-up capabilities to reduce cold start latency and enable automated model selection based on task complexity analysis.

[ ] Create comprehensive message-level caching system for conversation continuity in chat agents, including cache invalidation strategies, hit/miss metrics monitoring, and request-level caching for repeated tool operations.

[ ] Build multi-agent orchestration framework implementing the agents-as-tools pattern with workflow management, dependency tracking, concurrent tool execution, and agent specialization for domain-specific tasks.

[ ] Integrate OpenTelemetry for standardized instrumentation with trace collection for model and tool invocations, comprehensive performance dashboards, automated alerts for performance degradation, and user interaction feedback metrics.

[ ] Optimize tool execution performance with intelligent context-based tool selection, concurrent execution for independent operations via ToolExecutor, lazy initialization for tool loading, and tool result caching for expensive operations.

[ ] Implement real-time cost optimization framework with per-agent cost tracking, budgeting and alerting mechanisms, cost-aware model selection, token usage optimization recommendations, and cost analysis reporting dashboards.

[ ] Enhance security guardrails with advanced prompt injection defense patterns, structured input validation with clear section delimiters, adversarial example detection, Bedrock guardrails integration, and security audit trails for sensitive operations.

[ ] Create automated quality assurance system with agent behavior consistency testing, performance regression testing, output quality scoring, A/B testing framework for agent improvements, and continuous evaluation pipelines.
