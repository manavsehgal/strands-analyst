# Active Backlog

[x] Fix the deprecation warning that occurs when I quit the `analystai` CLI.
üó£Ô∏è  You: quit
üëã Thank you for using Analyst Chat. Goodbye!
<sys>:0: DeprecationWarning: builtin type swigvarlink has no __module__ attribute

**Completion Summary:** Fixed the swigvarlink deprecation warning by implementing comprehensive warning suppression in the CLI. The solution involved:
1. Enhanced `analyst/utils/shell_wrapper.py` with a new `suppress_swigvarlink_warning()` function to filter SWIG-wrapped C extension warnings
2. Updated `analyst/cli/chat.py` with early warning suppression, global deprecation warning filtering, and an atexit handler to ensure warnings remain suppressed throughout the program lifecycle
3. The fix addresses warnings from SWIG-based dependencies (likely PyMuPDF) that occur during Python's cleanup phase when exiting the CLI
4. Verified that the warning no longer appears when quitting the `analystai` CLI

[x] When `analystai` quits the Thank You message should be: 
"Thank you for using Strands Analyst AI. Hope you found it useful."
"Noticed an issue? Please report here https://github.com/manavsehgal/strands-analyst/issues"

**Completion Summary:** Updated the goodbye messages in the `analystai` CLI to provide a more informative and branded exit experience. The changes involved:
1. Replaced all goodbye messages in `analyst/cli/chat.py` at three locations (lines 149, 189, 194)
2. Updated the main quit message from "Thank you for using Analyst Chat. Goodbye!" to the new two-line format
3. Enhanced KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) and EOFError (Ctrl+D) handlers with the same consistent messaging
4. Added GitHub issues link to encourage user feedback and bug reporting
5. Verified the new messages display correctly when exiting the CLI with the "quit" command

[x] When running `analystai` add a feature to cycle through prior/next user prompts when user presses arrow up/down keys. Also add capability to use left/right and option/cmd combinations with left/right arrow keys to allow user to navigate the prompt text for fast editing. Also enable backspace. The editing experience should behave like a typical text editor.

**Completion Summary:** Enhanced the `analystai` CLI with comprehensive readline support for improved text editing experience. The implementation involved:
1. Added readline module import with graceful fallback for systems without readline support
2. Created `setup_readline()` function with platform-specific key bindings for macOS and Linux
3. Implemented command history persistence in `.history/chat_history` within the session directory
4. Configured key bindings for:
   - Up/Down arrows: Navigate command history (history-search-backward/forward)
   - Left/Right arrows: Move cursor within the text
   - Option+Left/Right (macOS) or Ctrl+Left/Right (Linux): Jump between words
   - Ctrl+A/E: Jump to beginning/end of line
   - Ctrl+K/U: Kill line operations for quick text deletion
   - Ctrl+W: Delete word backwards
   - Backspace: Already supported by default readline
5. Added `save_readline_history()` function to persist command history between sessions
6. Integrated readline setup into `interactive_chat()` with history loading/saving at session start/end
7. Fixed Python 3.13 escape sequence warnings by using raw strings for readline key bindings
8. Verified functionality with proper virtual environment activation and package reinstallation
