# Active Backlog

[x] Review the about_site/ folder. Separate the agent about_site and the tool fetch_url_metadata into reusable modules. Add a CLI command to parametrize the agent prompt so that `about site.com` runs the agent with the `site.com` argument replacing the hardcoded url in the prompt. Package the agent and tool so that it can be installed in a single command then the CLI command is available to the terminal.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Separated fetch_url_metadata tool into reusable module (about_site/tools.py)
    - ✅ Refactored agent.py into modular functions: create_about_site_agent(), analyze_site(), print_result_stats()
    - ✅ Created CLI interface in about_site/cli.py with parametrized URL argument
    - ✅ Added setup.py for package installation with entry point for 'about' command
    - ✅ Updated __init__.py to export all modules properly
    - ✅ Tested installation with `pip install -e .`
    - ✅ Verified CLI works: `about github.com` and `about anthropic.com` both function correctly
    
    The package can now be installed with a single command (`pip install -e .` for development or `pip install .` for production), 
    and the `about` command is available in the terminal. The tool accepts URLs as arguments and automatically adds https:// if not provided.

[x] I will build more agents and tools. The tools will be reusable by agents. Create a high level package folder called analyst/ and rename agent.py as agents/about_site.py following consitent naming between agents and CLI commands and arguments. Each tool should be own module using similar naming convention like tools/fetch_url_metadata.py

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Created analyst/ package structure with proper Python module hierarchy
    - ✅ Separated tools into analyst/tools/fetch_url_metadata.py (individual module for each tool)
    - ✅ Separated agents into analyst/agents/about_site.py (consistent naming with CLI commands)
    - ✅ Created CLI module structure at analyst/cli/about_site.py (matching agent names)
    - ✅ Updated all imports to use the new modular structure with relative imports
    - ✅ Updated setup.py to reference analyst package and entry point
    - ✅ Added requirements.txt for the analyst package
    - ✅ Tested installation with `pip install -e .`
    - ✅ Verified CLI works: `about google.com`, `about openai.com --verbose` both function correctly
    
    The new structure follows best practices for Python packages with clear separation of concerns:
    - analyst/tools/ - Reusable tools for agents
    - analyst/agents/ - Agent implementations
    - analyst/cli/ - CLI interfaces for agents
    
    This modular architecture enables easy addition of new agents and tools while maintaining consistency.

[x] Cleanup the redundant older code structure about_site/ safely.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Reviewed about_site/ folder contents (agent.py, cli.py, tools.py, requirements.txt, __pycache__)
    - ✅ Verified all functionality properly migrated to analyst/ package structure
    - ✅ Tested CLI functionality before cleanup to ensure new structure works
    - ✅ Safely removed redundant about_site/ folder with `rm -rf about_site/`
    - ✅ Reinstalled package to clean up egg-info files and remove stale references
    - ✅ Verified egg-info files now correctly reference only analyst/ package
    - ✅ Tested CLI after cleanup: `about tesla.com` works correctly with graceful error handling
    
    The cleanup successfully removed all redundant code while maintaining full functionality.
    Package now exclusively uses the clean analyst/ structure with no legacy references.

[x] Remain consistent in naming and rename function analyze_site to about_site in the analyst/agents/about_site.py. Review the prior and this backlog item to create a naming conventions section in CLAUDE.md so that new agents, CLI, and tools follow same conventions.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Renamed `analyze_site()` function to `about_site()` in analyst/agents/about_site.py for consistency
    - ✅ Updated all imports and references throughout the codebase (agents, CLI, main package)
    - ✅ Updated all documentation files (agents-guide.md, examples.md, developer-guide.md)
    - ✅ Reviewed prior backlog items to identify established naming patterns
    - ✅ Created comprehensive naming conventions section in CLAUDE.md covering:
      - Agent naming patterns (files, functions, creators)
      - Tool naming conventions (verb_noun pattern)
      - CLI naming consistency (commands match purpose)
      - Module structure guidelines
    - ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with current package architecture and development commands
    - ✅ Tested both CLI (`about github.com`) and direct API usage - all functionality works correctly
    - ✅ Package maintains full functionality while achieving consistent naming across all components
    
    The naming conventions now ensure consistency: agent functions match their file names, CLI commands match their purpose, and the entire package follows a coherent pattern that will guide future development.

[x] Create an agent called `news` which should take an RSS feed url as input and process the RSS using `rss` tool. The agent should then respond with latest 5 news items.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Created RSS tool in analyst/tools/fetch_rss_feed.py using feedparser for reliable RSS parsing
    - ✅ Implemented news agent in analyst/agents/news.py following established naming conventions
    - ✅ Created news CLI in analyst/cli/news.py with URL validation and verbose mode support
    - ✅ Updated setup.py to add 'news' console script entry point
    - ✅ Updated all __init__.py files to properly export new modules and functions
    - ✅ Successfully tested both BBC and CNN RSS feeds with proper error handling
    - ✅ Verified CLI works: `news http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml` and `news <rss_url> --verbose`
    - ✅ Package installation updated and working correctly
    
    The news agent successfully fetches RSS feeds, parses them using feedparser, and presents the latest 5 news items in a well-formatted, readable manner. The tool handles SSL errors gracefully, provides proper error messages, and follows the established modular architecture pattern.

[x] Use strands-agents-tools rss tool instead of creating a custom tool

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Researched built-in RSS tool from strands_tools package (strands-agents-tools)
    - ✅ Updated analyst/agents/news.py to import and use `rss` from strands_tools instead of custom tool
    - ✅ Modified news agent prompt to work with built-in tool's action-based interface (action="fetch")
    - ✅ Removed custom analyst/tools/fetch_rss_feed.py file completely
    - ✅ Updated all package imports and exports in __init__.py files to remove custom tool references  
    - ✅ Reinstalled package successfully with updated structure
    - ✅ Tested with BBC and NPR RSS feeds - both work correctly with proper formatting
    - ✅ Verified verbose mode works with model statistics display
    
    The news agent now uses the professional-grade built-in RSS tool from strands-agents-tools, which provides better error handling, supports multiple actions (fetch, subscribe, search), and is maintained by the Strands team. The implementation is cleaner and more reliable than the custom tool.

[x] Create a custom tool for RSS feed reading which also reads news descriptions. The strands-agents-tools rss tool does not read description correctly so remove that from dependencies and replace the tool usage within news agent to custom tool.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Created custom RSS tool fetch_rss_content.py with proper description extraction
    - ✅ Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for content extraction (content, summary, description, subtitle fields)
    - ✅ Added HTML tag cleaning and entity decoding for readable descriptions
    - ✅ Removed strands-agents-tools[rss] dependency and replaced with feedparser>=6.0.10
    - ✅ Updated news agent to use custom tool instead of built-in RSS tool
    - ✅ Modified agent prompt to work with custom tool interface (url and max_items parameters)
    - ✅ Updated all package imports and exports to include new RSS tool
    - ✅ Tested with BBC and NPR RSS feeds - now shows proper descriptions instead of "No description available"
    - ✅ Verified verbose mode and author extraction working correctly
    
    The custom RSS tool significantly improves content extraction compared to the built-in tool. It properly extracts descriptions, summaries, and content from various RSS formats, cleans HTML markup, and provides rich context for each news item. The tool handles multiple content field types and provides fallback mechanisms for different RSS feed structures.

[x] Add a `config.yml` file in project root. Make number of news items to read from RSS configurable for the rss tool as well as the new agent. Default to first 10 news items only.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Created config.yml file in project root with RSS, news, and app configuration sections
    - ✅ Built comprehensive configuration loading utility (analyst/config.py) with YAML support
    - ✅ Added PyYAML>=6.0 dependency for configuration parsing
    - ✅ Updated RSS tool to use configurable max_items (defaults to config.yml value)
    - ✅ Enhanced news agent to accept max_items parameter with configuration defaults
    - ✅ Expanded CLI with --count/-c option to override configuration defaults
    - ✅ Implemented maximum limit enforcement (max_items capped at 50 from config)
    - ✅ Updated help text to show current configuration values dynamically
    - ✅ Added configuration module to package exports for programmatic access
    - ✅ Tested all scenarios: default (10 items), custom counts (3 items), configuration limits
    
    The configuration system provides flexible control over RSS item limits while maintaining sensible defaults. Users can now configure globally via config.yml or override per-command via CLI. The system properly validates limits and provides clear feedback about current settings.

[x] Optimize the analyst/tools/fetch_rss_content.py to only process the configured max_items number of feed items and not process the entire feed so that it returns results faster with less payload.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Replaced slice-based processing with early termination loop for efficiency
    - ✅ Added processed_count tracking to break immediately when max_items reached
    - ✅ Implemented early entry validation to skip invalid entries (no title/link)
    - ✅ Optimized description extraction with early termination once description found
    - ✅ Added string content validation to avoid processing empty fields
    - ✅ Streamlined category extraction logic for better performance
    - ✅ Reduced unnecessary getattr() calls by caching title/link values
    - ✅ Tested performance improvements: 0.13 seconds for 5 items vs. previous full processing
    - ✅ Verified functionality intact with BBC and NPR feeds (all features working)
    - ✅ Confirmed CLI integration, verbose mode, and configuration system still work perfectly
    
    The optimization significantly improves performance by processing only the required number of items instead of the entire feed. The tool now breaks early when it has enough items, skips invalid entries, and uses early termination for content extraction, resulting in faster response times with reduced computational overhead.

[x] Use the analyst/prompts/ folder which will have about_site.md and news.md files with the string for hydrating the message variable in respective agents/ files.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Created comprehensive prompt management utility (analyst/prompts.py) with loading, caching, and formatting functions
    - ✅ Verified existing prompt files (analyst/prompts/about_site.md and news.md) contained correct prompt templates
    - ✅ Updated about_site agent to use format_prompt_cached() instead of hardcoded prompt strings
    - ✅ Updated news agent to use format_prompt_cached() with variable substitution (max_items, rss_url)
    - ✅ Added prompt utility functions to package exports in __init__.py
    - ✅ Reinstalled package to ensure all imports work correctly
    - ✅ Tested both CLI commands: `about github.com` and `news <url> --count 3` - both work perfectly
    - ✅ Verified prompt templates are properly loaded, cached for performance, and formatted with variables
    
    The agent architecture now uses external prompt files for better maintainability and flexibility. Prompts are cached for performance and can be easily modified without touching agent code. The system supports variable substitution (like {url}, {max_items}, {rss_url}) for dynamic prompt generation.

[ ] Simplify the agents/ code by extracting the logging and priting stats code into reusable decorators. Make them both configurable and comprehensive modules after reading logging docs https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/observability-evaluation/logs/ and metrics docs https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/observability-evaluation/metrics/. Rename stats as metrics.
