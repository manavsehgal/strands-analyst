# Active Backlog

[x] Review the about_site/ folder. Separate the agent about_site and the tool fetch_url_metadata into reusable modules. Add a CLI command to parametrize the agent prompt so that `about site.com` runs the agent with the `site.com` argument replacing the hardcoded url in the prompt. Package the agent and tool so that it can be installed in a single command then the CLI command is available to the terminal.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Separated fetch_url_metadata tool into reusable module (about_site/tools.py)
    - ✅ Refactored agent.py into modular functions: create_about_site_agent(), analyze_site(), print_result_stats()
    - ✅ Created CLI interface in about_site/cli.py with parametrized URL argument
    - ✅ Added setup.py for package installation with entry point for 'about' command
    - ✅ Updated __init__.py to export all modules properly
    - ✅ Tested installation with `pip install -e .`
    - ✅ Verified CLI works: `about github.com` and `about anthropic.com` both function correctly
    
    The package can now be installed with a single command (`pip install -e .` for development or `pip install .` for production), 
    and the `about` command is available in the terminal. The tool accepts URLs as arguments and automatically adds https:// if not provided.

[x] I will build more agents and tools. The tools will be reusable by agents. Create a high level package folder called analyst/ and rename agent.py as agents/about_site.py following consitent naming between agents and CLI commands and arguments. Each tool should be own module using similar naming convention like tools/fetch_url_metadata.py

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Created analyst/ package structure with proper Python module hierarchy
    - ✅ Separated tools into analyst/tools/fetch_url_metadata.py (individual module for each tool)
    - ✅ Separated agents into analyst/agents/about_site.py (consistent naming with CLI commands)
    - ✅ Created CLI module structure at analyst/cli/about_site.py (matching agent names)
    - ✅ Updated all imports to use the new modular structure with relative imports
    - ✅ Updated setup.py to reference analyst package and entry point
    - ✅ Added requirements.txt for the analyst package
    - ✅ Tested installation with `pip install -e .`
    - ✅ Verified CLI works: `about google.com`, `about openai.com --verbose` both function correctly
    
    The new structure follows best practices for Python packages with clear separation of concerns:
    - analyst/tools/ - Reusable tools for agents
    - analyst/agents/ - Agent implementations
    - analyst/cli/ - CLI interfaces for agents
    
    This modular architecture enables easy addition of new agents and tools while maintaining consistency.

[x] Cleanup the redundant older code structure about_site/ safely.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Reviewed about_site/ folder contents (agent.py, cli.py, tools.py, requirements.txt, __pycache__)
    - ✅ Verified all functionality properly migrated to analyst/ package structure
    - ✅ Tested CLI functionality before cleanup to ensure new structure works
    - ✅ Safely removed redundant about_site/ folder with `rm -rf about_site/`
    - ✅ Reinstalled package to clean up egg-info files and remove stale references
    - ✅ Verified egg-info files now correctly reference only analyst/ package
    - ✅ Tested CLI after cleanup: `about tesla.com` works correctly with graceful error handling
    
    The cleanup successfully removed all redundant code while maintaining full functionality.
    Package now exclusively uses the clean analyst/ structure with no legacy references.

[x] Remain consistent in naming and rename function analyze_site to about_site in the analyst/agents/about_site.py. Review the prior and this backlog item to create a naming conventions section in CLAUDE.md so that new agents, CLI, and tools follow same conventions.

    **Completion Summary (2025-08-31):**
    - ✅ Renamed `analyze_site()` function to `about_site()` in analyst/agents/about_site.py for consistency
    - ✅ Updated all imports and references throughout the codebase (agents, CLI, main package)
    - ✅ Updated all documentation files (agents-guide.md, examples.md, developer-guide.md)
    - ✅ Reviewed prior backlog items to identify established naming patterns
    - ✅ Created comprehensive naming conventions section in CLAUDE.md covering:
      - Agent naming patterns (files, functions, creators)
      - Tool naming conventions (verb_noun pattern)
      - CLI naming consistency (commands match purpose)
      - Module structure guidelines
    - ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with current package architecture and development commands
    - ✅ Tested both CLI (`about github.com`) and direct API usage - all functionality works correctly
    - ✅ Package maintains full functionality while achieving consistent naming across all components
    
    The naming conventions now ensure consistency: agent functions match their file names, CLI commands match their purpose, and the entire package follows a coherent pattern that will guide future development.
