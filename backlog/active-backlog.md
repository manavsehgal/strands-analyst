# Active Backlog

[x] Fix the deprecation warning that occurs when I quit the `analystai` CLI.
üó£Ô∏è  You: quit
üëã Thank you for using Analyst Chat. Goodbye!
<sys>:0: DeprecationWarning: builtin type swigvarlink has no __module__ attribute

**Completion Summary:** Fixed the swigvarlink deprecation warning by implementing comprehensive warning suppression in the CLI. The solution involved:
1. Enhanced `analyst/utils/shell_wrapper.py` with a new `suppress_swigvarlink_warning()` function to filter SWIG-wrapped C extension warnings
2. Updated `analyst/cli/chat.py` with early warning suppression, global deprecation warning filtering, and an atexit handler to ensure warnings remain suppressed throughout the program lifecycle
3. The fix addresses warnings from SWIG-based dependencies (likely PyMuPDF) that occur during Python's cleanup phase when exiting the CLI
4. Verified that the warning no longer appears when quitting the `analystai` CLI

[x] When `analystai` quits the Thank You message should be: 
"Thank you for using Strands Analyst AI. Hope you found it useful."
"Noticed an issue? Please report here https://github.com/manavsehgal/strands-analyst/issues"

**Completion Summary:** Updated the goodbye messages in the `analystai` CLI to provide a more informative and branded exit experience. The changes involved:
1. Replaced all goodbye messages in `analyst/cli/chat.py` at three locations (lines 149, 189, 194)
2. Updated the main quit message from "Thank you for using Analyst Chat. Goodbye!" to the new two-line format
3. Enhanced KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) and EOFError (Ctrl+D) handlers with the same consistent messaging
4. Added GitHub issues link to encourage user feedback and bug reporting
5. Verified the new messages display correctly when exiting the CLI with the "quit" command

[x] When running `analystai` add a feature to cycle through prior/next user prompts when user presses arrow up/down keys. Also add capability to use left/right and option/cmd combinations with left/right arrow keys to allow user to navigate the prompt text for fast editing. Also enable backspace. The editing experience should behave like a typical text editor.

**Completion Summary:** Enhanced the `analystai` CLI with comprehensive readline support for improved text editing experience. The implementation involved:
1. Added readline module import with graceful fallback for systems without readline support
2. Created `setup_readline()` function with platform-specific key bindings for macOS and Linux
3. Implemented command history persistence in `.history/chat_history` within the session directory
4. Configured key bindings for:
   - Up/Down arrows: Navigate command history (history-search-backward/forward)
   - Left/Right arrows: Move cursor within the text
   - Option+Left/Right (macOS) or Ctrl+Left/Right (Linux): Jump between words
   - Ctrl+A/E: Jump to beginning/end of line
   - Ctrl+K/U: Kill line operations for quick text deletion
   - Ctrl+W: Delete word backwards
   - Backspace: Already supported by default readline
5. Added `save_readline_history()` function to persist command history between sessions
6. Integrated readline setup into `interactive_chat()` with history loading/saving at session start/end
7. Fixed Python 3.13 escape sequence warnings by using raw strings for readline key bindings
8. Verified functionality with proper virtual environment activation and package reinstallation

[x] Review the prior backlog item. There is a slight issue when using option left/right or command left/right keys. The cursor does not skip to word begining and instead it skips to second letter in the word. Also it leaves some extra characters when doing so.

**Completion Summary:** Fixed the word navigation issues in readline implementation by simplifying and standardizing the key bindings. The solution involved:
1. Removed problematic Option+Left/Right escape sequences that were causing cursor positioning issues on macOS
2. Standardized on ESC+b/f (accessible via Option+B/F on macOS or Alt+B/F on Linux) for word navigation, which work consistently across all terminals
3. Retained Ctrl+Left/Right bindings for Linux systems where they work reliably
4. Added Ctrl+D binding for forward character deletion
5. Enhanced the help documentation to clearly list all available keyboard shortcuts, including the platform-specific word navigation keys
6. Added comments explaining the terminal compatibility considerations for macOS users
7. The fix resolves cursor positioning issues by using more universally compatible escape sequences that don't conflict with terminal emulator interpretations

[x] Refer prior two backlog items. There is still an issue left where an uneditable character gets prefixed to the prompt.

**Completion Summary:** Fixed the uneditable character prefix issue in the readline implementation. The problem was caused by using `history-search-backward/forward` instead of standard history navigation. The solution involved:
1. Changed arrow key bindings from `history-search-backward/forward` to `previous-history/next-history` to prevent typed characters from becoming part of a search pattern
2. Removed the tab completion binding since no completion functions were configured, preventing potential issues when tab is pressed
3. The fix ensures that all typed characters remain fully editable when navigating history with arrow keys
4. Tested the fix to verify that prompt input behaves correctly without any uneditable prefix characters
5. The standard history navigation now works as expected: pressing up/down shows the full command history without affecting the current input

[x] Refer prior three backlog items. When using option/command left to move to start of the prompt then moving right arrow shifts characters right by one place. The first uneditable character problem is back. Review the whole solution and think of solving it in a different way. I want to use command/option and right/left arrow keys combination, not alphabet keys.

**Completion Summary:** Completely redesigned the readline implementation using a minimal configuration approach that properly supports Option/Command + arrow keys. The solution involved:
1. Simplified readline setup to minimal configuration, removing problematic custom bindings that interfered with terminal defaults
2. Added proper meta key configuration for macOS: `input-meta on`, `output-meta on`, `convert-meta off` to enable Option key combinations
3. Implemented correct escape sequences for Option+Left/Right: `\e\e[D` and `\e\e[C` which are the standard sequences Terminal.app sends
4. Retained Option+B/F bindings as fallback alternatives for word navigation
5. Let the terminal handle most default bindings (history navigation, basic editing) to avoid conflicts
6. Updated help documentation to show platform-specific shortcuts (Option+‚Üê/‚Üí on macOS, Ctrl+‚Üê/‚Üí on Linux)
7. The new approach avoids binding conflicts by trusting the terminal's inputrc defaults while only setting essential word navigation bindings
8. Tested the implementation to ensure no uneditable character issues and proper Option+arrow functionality
