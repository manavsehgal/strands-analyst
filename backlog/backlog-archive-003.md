      🌐 Url: https://github.com
    Now I'll save this to a file:
    
    🔧 Tool: save_file
      📄 File: github-info.md
      📝 Text: # GitHub Metadata...
    Successfully completed both operations!
    ```
    
    **All Issues Resolved**:
    ✅ **Tool names on new lines** - Proper formatting with line breaks  
    ✅ **URL and file path display** - Shows inputs with 🌐 and 📄 icons  
    ✅ **No "Text: GET" noise** - Filtered out HTTP methods and short technical values  
    ✅ **Error explanations** - Connection errors and HTTP failures explained in responses  
    ✅ **Smart text truncation** - Long text inputs properly truncated with "..."  
    ✅ **Full response preservation** - All assistant text streaming works normally  
    
    **Tool Status Research**: After analyzing Strands SDK documentation, tool-level completion status (success/error indicators) is not directly available through current callback events or hooks. The available hooks (`BeforeInvocationEvent`, `AfterInvocationEvent`) are agent-level, not tool-specific. Current implementation provides implicit status through execution flow and error explanations in response text.
    
    **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE & FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - All requested features implemented and working perfectly.

[x] When running `analystai` command when I use the command `session` I get this error: Error in chat session: 'Agent' object has no attribute 'session_manager'

    **Completion Summary (2025-09-06):**
    - ✅ **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified that Strands Agent class doesn't expose session_manager as a directly accessible attribute via `agent.session_manager` in `analyst/agents/chat.py:489`
    - ✅ **Session Manager Storage Fix**: Modified `create_chat_agent()` function to store session manager reference as custom attribute:
      - **Added custom attribute**: `agent._session_manager = session_manager` for reliable access in `get_session_info()`
      - **Preserved original functionality**: Session manager still passed to Agent constructor for framework integration
      - **Clean architecture**: Custom attribute approach maintains compatibility without breaking existing code
    - ✅ **Session Info Access Enhancement**: Updated `get_session_info()` function with robust session manager access:
      - **Safe attribute access**: `getattr(agent, '_session_manager', None)` prevents AttributeError
      - **Enhanced directory detection**: Multiple fallback methods to extract session directory from session manager
      - **Graceful error handling**: Returns proper fallback values when session manager is not available
    - ✅ **Session Directory Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive session directory detection logic:
      - **Direct attribute access**: First tries `session_manager.session_dir`
      - **Storage attribute access**: Fallback to `session_manager.storage.session_dir`
      - **Private attribute access**: Checks `session_manager._session_dir` for internal attributes
      - **Dictionary scan**: Searches all manager attributes for session_dir-related values
    - ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Validated session command functionality across multiple scenarios:
      - **Interactive mode**: `echo "session" | analystai` displays proper session information
      - **Error elimination**: No more `'Agent' object has no attribute 'session_manager'` error
      - **Session ID display**: Shows unique session IDs (e.g., `39ea429a-d469-48f2-9469-2ab532bf57fe`)
      - **Session status**: Correctly displays "Has Session: True" for active sessions

    **Key Features Fixed**:
    - **Session command functionality**: `session` command in interactive chat mode works without errors
    - **Session information display**: Shows session ID, status, and attempts to show directory
    - **Error-free operation**: Eliminates AttributeError that was breaking session command
    - **Backward compatibility**: No changes to existing agent creation or usage patterns

    **Technical Implementation**:
    - **Custom attribute pattern**: Uses `_session_manager` private attribute for reliable access
    - **Defensive programming**: Safe attribute access with getattr() and proper fallback values
    - **Multiple access paths**: Comprehensive session directory detection with fallback strategies
    - **Minimal code changes**: Two targeted edits in `analyst/agents/chat.py` (lines 424 and 493)

    **Result**: The `session` command in `analystai` interactive mode now works correctly without errors. Users can view their current session information including session ID and status. The fix preserves all existing functionality while resolving the AttributeError that was preventing session command usage.
