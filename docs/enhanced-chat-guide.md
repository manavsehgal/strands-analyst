## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Consent Management

### Smart Consent System

The system uses intelligent consent management:

- **üîì Safe Operations** - Automatic approval for read-only operations
- **‚ö†Ô∏è System Operations** - Explicit consent required for potentially dangerous actions
- **üîí File Modifications** - User approval needed for file writing/editing
- **üíª Shell Access** - Consent prompts for system commands

### Consent Flow Example

```bash
> take a screenshot using shell command
‚ö†Ô∏è  Security Notice: The assistant wants to execute a shell command:
   Command: screencapture ~/Desktop/screenshot.png
   
   This command will:
   - Take a screenshot of your current desktop
   - Save it to ~/Desktop/screenshot.png
   
   Do you want to allow this? [y/N]: y
   
üîß Executing shell command...
‚úÖ Screenshot saved successfully!
```

### Security Best Practices

- **Explicit warnings** for system-level operations
- **Command preview** before execution
- **User education** about potential risks
- **Graceful degradation** when consent is denied
