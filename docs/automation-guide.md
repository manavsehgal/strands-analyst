# Computer & Browser Automation Guide

Strands Analyst provides computer and browser automation capabilities through system tools with proper security controls. This guide covers available automation features and security practices.

## Overview

Strands Analyst provides automation capabilities through community tools including the **shell tool**. For security and user protection:

- ⚠️  **User consent required** for system-level operations that can modify your computer
- 🔒 **Security-first approach** with explicit permission prompts for dangerous operations
- 💻 **Cross-platform support** with system command integration  
- 🛡️  **Safe defaults** - read-only operations don't require consent, write operations do
- 📝 **Clear permissions** - you'll be asked before any system modifications

## Quick Start

```bash
# Computer automation
analystchat "take a screenshot of my desktop using shell"
analystchat "get my screen resolution using shell" 

# Browser automation
analystchat "screenshot google.com using shell and playwright"
analystchat "create a PDF of stripe.com using shell"

# System operations
analystchat "find all Python files using shell"
analystchat "open Safari using shell"
```

## Computer Automation

# Screenshot with wait
analystchat "use shell to screenshot after load: playwright screenshot --wait-for-selector=h1 https://example.com ~/Desktop/example.png"
```

### PDF Generation

```bash
# Generate PDF from website
analystchat "use shell to create PDF: playwright pdf https://anthropic.com ~/Desktop/anthropic.pdf"

# PDF with custom format
analystchat "use shell for A4 PDF: playwright pdf --format=A4 https://stripe.com ~/Desktop/stripe-A4.pdf"

# PDF with margins
analystchat "use shell for PDF with margins: playwright pdf --margin=20 https://example.com ~/Desktop/example-margin.pdf"
```

### Browser Control

```bash
# Open websites in browsers
analystchat "use shell to open in Safari: open -a Safari https://google.com"
analystchat "use shell to open in Chrome: open -a 'Google Chrome' https://stripe.com"
analystchat "use shell to open in Firefox: open -a Firefox https://anthropic.com"

# Open multiple tabs
analystchat "use shell to open multiple sites: open -a Safari https://google.com https://github.com"
```

## Advanced Automation

### AppleScript Integration (macOS)

```bash
# Safari automation via AppleScript
analystchat "use shell with AppleScript: osascript -e 'tell application \"Safari\" to make new document with properties {URL:\"https://google.com\"}'"

# Chrome automation via AppleScript  
analystchat "use shell with AppleScript: osascript -e 'tell application \"Google Chrome\" to make new tab with properties {URL:\"https://github.com\"}'"

# System dialogs
analystchat "use shell for dialog: osascript -e 'display dialog \"Hello from automation!\"'"
```

### Batch Operations

```bash
# Multiple screenshots
analystchat "use shell to screenshot multiple sites: for site in google.com github.com stripe.com; do playwright screenshot https://$site ~/Desktop/$site.png; done"

# Process multiple files
analystchat "use shell to process files: for file in *.txt; do echo \"Processing $file\"; done"
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Set automation environment
analystchat "use shell to set env: export AUTOMATION_MODE=true"

# Check environment
analystchat "use shell to check env: env | grep -i automation"
```

## Configuration

### Consent Settings

The automation system is configured in `config.yml` to bypass all consent prompts:

```yaml
community_tools:
  consent:
    require_consent: false          # Disabled for seamless operation
    
  tools:
    shell:
      enabled: true
      require_consent: false        # Primary automation tool
      
    use_computer:
      enabled: false                # Disabled due to consent issues
      
    browser:
      enabled: false                # Disabled due to consent issues
```

### Environment Variables

The system automatically sets these variables:

```bash
BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true           # Bypass all consent prompts
STRANDS_DISABLE_CACHE=true         # Prevent caching issues
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Playwright not found**
```bash
# Install Playwright
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

**2. Permission denied for screenshots**
```bash
# Grant screen recording permission in System Preferences > Security & Privacy
```

**3. Shell commands not working**
```bash
# Check shell path
analystchat "use shell to check path: echo $PATH"

# Test basic shell access
analystchat "use shell to test: echo 'Shell is working'"
```

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check system
analystchat "use shell for system check: uname -a && which python3 && which playwright"

# Test Playwright
analystchat "use shell to test playwright: playwright --version"

# Check permissions
analystchat "use shell to check perms: ls -la ~/.playwright"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Commands
```bash
# Good
analystchat "use shell to take a screenshot of my desktop and save it to ~/Desktop/work-screenshot.png"

# Better  
analystchat "take a desktop screenshot using shell tool with timestamp in filename"
```

### 2. Specify Full Paths
```bash
# Recommended
analystchat "use shell to screenshot: playwright screenshot https://example.com ~/Desktop/example.png"

# Avoid relative paths in automation
```

### 3. Chain Related Operations
```bash
# Efficient
analystchat "use shell to: take a screenshot, then open the file in Preview"
```

### 4. Handle Errors Gracefully
```bash
# With error handling
analystchat "use shell to take screenshot with error check: if screencapture ~/Desktop/shot.png; then echo 'Success'; else echo 'Failed'; fi"
```

## Examples by Use Case

### Website Testing

```bash
# Test website accessibility
analystchat "use shell to test site: playwright screenshot --viewport-size=1920,1080 https://mysite.com ~/Desktop/desktop-view.png && playwright screenshot --viewport-size=375,667 https://mysite.com ~/Desktop/mobile-view.png"
```

### Content Creation

```bash
# Create presentation materials
analystchat "use shell to capture slides: playwright pdf --format=A4 --landscape https://slides.com/presentation ~/Desktop/slides.pdf"
```

### System Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor system resources
analystchat "use shell to monitor system: top -l 1 | head -20 > ~/Desktop/system-status.txt && echo 'System status saved'"
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Automated testing screenshots
analystchat "use shell for dev testing: playwright screenshot http://localhost:3000 ~/Desktop/dev-screenshot.png"
```

## Platform-Specific Commands

## Security Notes

- All automation commands run with user privileges
- No elevated permissions required for standard operations
- Consent prompts are bypassed for seamless operation but sensitive operations should be reviewed
- Shell commands are executed in the user's environment

## Performance Tips

1. **Use specific selectors** for web elements
2. **Set appropriate timeouts** for page loads
3. **Batch related operations** for efficiency
4. **Use headless mode** for faster web automation
5. **Cache screenshots** when possible for repeated use

## Integration with Other Tools

The shell-based automation integrates seamlessly with:

- **Git operations**: Version control via shell
- **Package managers**: npm, pip, brew via shell
- **Build systems**: Make, gradle, webpack via shell  
- **Deployment tools**: Docker, kubectl via shell
