Think harder to complete these steps:
1. Review backlog/active-backlog.md to identify the next open [ ] backlog item
2. If multiple open items are present, pick only next one in sequence.
3. Review project to understand the current state of implementation
4. Complete the open backlog item
5. Append completion summary after the backlog item and close [x] it
