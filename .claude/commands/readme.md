Think harder to write or update the README.md in the style of professional, popular GitHub repos with factual content based on this project. 
1. Refer docs/, backlog/, try-prompts.yml, and analyst/ code for content of features released and what this project is about.
2. Selectively use exemplary content from analystai-content/ folder (embed images referencing the origin folders correctly) and refer/ folder to highlight key features and capabilities of Strands Analyst.
3. Ensure any tools related dependencies outside of those mentioned in the project files have install/pre-requisites instructions like Graphviz for diagrams tool.
4. Leverage GitHub advanced formatting and GitHub flavored markdown strategically to make the README.md more usable and readable.
